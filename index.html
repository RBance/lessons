  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm Reuben, a pianist, composer, and music researcher currently based in Cambridge. I began my formal music education under the guidance of renowned composer Joseph Phibbs, and since then I've had pieces performed in venues ranging from Cadogan Hall in London to chapels around Cambridge. I studied piano with Gareth Hunt, before reading music at King's College, Cambridge, where I graduated with the highest examination results in the university for my subject. While at Cambridge, I conducted the King's College Symphony Orchestra, performing large orchestral works in the College's world-famous chapel. For the last three years, I have been teaching piano in the UK and abroad, as well as running several composition courses in Antigua and Barbuda with The Commonwealth Resounds. I teach students of all ages and backgrounds, but I have significant experience teaching primary school-aged children. I have a 100% retention rate among my regular piano students.</p>
